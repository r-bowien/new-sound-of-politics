Actors have an inner (true) state that cannot be observed (even by themselves). However, them articulating their political position is the closest thing we have to observing the inner state of actors as actions such as voting behaviour is subject to external circumstances such as party discipline or strategic voting.
Purely quantitative approach utilises machine learning. Enables researchers to not having to read text at all except for validating. supervised machine learning is based on a training set with predefined labels such as negative or positive and a test set without labels where the attributes of the training set such as quantity of words with certain labels is estimated. The key to good quality here is a good quality training set rather than the quantitiy of training texts in the set. Unsupervised learning does not have a seperate learning step. It creates clusters that maximise the difference between them and minimise differences within them. This is good for topical analyses but overall has less usage in political science.

	abstract = {Mazzoleni, Stewart, Horsfield, and their contributors analyze the two-way relationship of the mass media and the contemporary phenomenon of extreme right wing neo-populist political parties which emerged in the closing years of the 20th century across the world. The success of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the neo-populist Front National, in the first French presidential ballot in April 2002 shows that these extremist parties have strong, if varying, electoral support. Drawn into reporting on the policies and antigovernment critiques of the new parties, the mass communication institutions, especially those engaged in news production, have been challenged by a variety of unconventional but effective political campaign strategies that caused many media professionals considerable challenge.Taking an approach informed by mass communication theory, this book analyzes eight case studies of the interaction of news media dynamics and neo-populism in Austria, Australia, France, Canada, India, Italy, the United States, and the Latin American region against the background of widespread disenchantment with traditional parties and the complacency and cynicism of popularly elected governments. Insights into media responses reveal how dependent on media coverage the neo-populist parties were and how, in many cases, the media were initially unequal to the confronting ideologies of the new parties. Although the news media exploited the new parties, new parties exploited the news media as well in quite shrewd and original ways. This is an important resource for scholars, students, and other researchers involved with political mass communications and right-wing political organizations.},

“In the third (still emerging) age of media abundance, political communication may be reshaped by five trends: intensified professionalizing imperatives, increased competitive pressures, anti-elitist populism, a process of “centrifugal diversification,” and changes in how people receive politics.”


Identifies 5 future research priorities:


“how political communicators and media organizations are navigating change, redefining their purposes, and resolving their conflicts”


Agenda setting: “Are media agendas diversifying across the many different outlets of political communication, and, if so, how are they being received by the audiences of those outlets?”


dissolving key boundaries: non-political genres mix increasingly with political ones, issues from any topic are easily politicized. political journalism becomes increasingly more entertainment


politicians know how the new type of communication works and aim to utilise it for their advantage. But do citizens know about it aswell and if so, how do they deal with it?


“For whom and in what ways, if any, are these populist approaches and programs involving? Do they cultivate different perceptions of what politicians are like as communicators and political problem solvers from those conveyed in the news, ads, and conventional interviews? What audience and citizen roles dothey encourage people to adopt?”



argues that “Media organizations are driven to seek ways of making politics more palatable and acceptable to audience members.” --{\textgreater} media outlets have been adjusting their language already before social media. General trend in communication began before. Interesting here: plot when social media platform was founded/emerged and when shift in political speeches occured.

	abstract = {The recent rise of populist politicians in Western democracies is often associated with their allegedly successful use of digital media. However, for a long time, there has been little research specifically on populist online communication. To address this substantial research gap, the thesis pursues two major research aims: First, it investigates drivers of populist communication in politicians’ online self-presentation and online news media representation. Second, the thesis examines the effects of populist online communication on citizens’ behavior in the form of user reactions to politicians’ social media posts and reader comments on online news articles. Based on five internationally comparative studies and the overarching synopsis, the cumulative thesis demonstrates that populist online communication is driven by the reciprocal interactions among politicians, journalists, and citizens and is influenced by various factors on the macro, meso, and micro level. Furthermore, it shows that populist online communication resonates with citizens and is multiplied by them – specifically by citizens with prior strong populist attitudes. By analyzing the interactions of three key actor groups – politicians, journalists, and citizens – and by following a multimethod approach the dissertation connects research on both the supply and demand side of populism.},

It presents and discusses empirical evidence on Italy’s populist and non-populist leaders that use Facebook regularly, and highlights the extent of the overﬂow of populist communication patterns and ideological features into mainstream political communication. Populist ideology fragments emerged in Italian leaders’ Facebook posts, thus leading to two main conclusions: ﬁrst, populism appears to be ‘endemic’ in the Italian online facebooksphere; second, political actors—even non-populist ones—do not disdain the adoption of typical populist rhetorics.},

Specifically, we examine the influence of Friendship-Driven (FD) and Interest-Driven (ID) online activity on online participatory politics and on offline forms of political action. Our findings reveal that FD and ID activity relate to political engagement, but in different ways. In addition, we find that the size of young people’s social networks interacts with both FD and ID online activity to promote political activity. This indicates that having exposure to “weak-ties” (resulting from large social networks) promote higher levels of political engagement. These findings demonstrate the need to specify the kinds of online activities in which youth are engaged and, more broadly, the political significance of social media and social networks},

More recently, microblogging services (e.g., Twitter) and social network sites (e.g., Facebook) are believed to have the potential for increasing political participation. While Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions publicly through their networks, political institutions (e.g., politicians, political parties, political foundations, etc.) have also begun to use Facebook pages or groups for the purpose of entering into direct dialogs with citizens and encouraging more political discussions. Previous studies have shown that from the perspective of political institutions, there is an emerging need to continuously collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize politically relevant information from social media. These activities, which are subsumed under “social media analytics,” are considered difficult tasks due to a large numbers of different social media platforms as well as the large amount and complexity of information and data. Systematic tracking and analysis approaches along with appropriate scientific methods and techniques in political domain are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework for social media analytics in political context.
