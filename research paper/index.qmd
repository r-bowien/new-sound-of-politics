# Introduction

Politians need to find different means of getting their issues on the public agenda. In the recent years we could observe how populist opposition greatly utilised social media to distribute populist narratives and was successful with it (higher vote shares in parliamentary elections across Europe and there have been populist governments in Italy, Poland, Hungary, Czechia, ...). moderate and non-populist political actors have struggled to withstand the populist shift. This may be partially due to the less successful use of social media as a communications tool. Parties in the center and in government only recently started to catch up on populist politicians in terms of social media reach and are still behind \[SOURCE\].

## Research Question

Do politicians adjust their tone to generate more reach on social media? If so, does this lead to a more pronounced populist or popular tone? –\> what is the success strategy for which parties on social media?

# Literature Review

Defining populism is a near impossible task, scholars have even referred to this struggle as with Cinderella complex (Aschenputtel-Komplex): There is a shoe formed like populism, but there is not fitting foot [@priester_rechter_2012]. Although there is no consensus about the definition of populist rhetoric, three common traits can be identified: An appeal to "the people", attacking the elites, and ostracising outgroups from the ingroup [@mazzoleni_socially_2018]. An extensive amount of literature relies on these concepts \[SOURCES\], this paper therefore uses them too and adds two more that enhance the grasp of the concept but have not been used as widely.

First, while definitions of populist rhetoric exclude a charismatic leader, definitions of the general concept of populism include it [@mazzoleni_socially_2018; @ SOURCES]. This paper translates a populist movement having a charismatic leader to a trait of populist rhetoric by identifying what kind of rhetoric it needs to establish a charismatic leader. Literature suggests that this kind of rhetoric requires personalization, direct connection and emotional appeal \[SOURCES\].

Second, literature sometimes mentions another aspect of populism: making use of a "glorified heartland" and an "idealized conception of community" [@taggart_populism_2004; @engesser_populism_2017]. This aspect of populism will be incorporated into the definition of populist rhetoric as "retrospective utopia" [@priester_rechter_2012].

Few scholars try to classify other types of rhetoric. Everything is either populist or not. This lack of concept poses a problem since it makes it difficult to understand multi-faceted rhetoric styles. The literature that mentions popular rhetoric describes it as a somewhat weaker or softer form of populism, e.g. media populism that populists apply to ensure the medias interest in their messaging [@mazzoleni_media_2003]. This dynamic fosters a continuing diffusion of what is populist and what is popular behaviour [@mazzoleni_media_2003] NEED MORE SOURCES\].

One distinction that is made

Popular rhetoric may be even harder to define. As a term that

How to define popular rhetoric? What makes it different to populist rhetoric? (maybe only adhere to the people and charismatic leader while missing the other 2 aspects)

A lot of research on populist rhetoric in the current age focuses on social media content posted by politicians [@stieglitz2013; SOURCES], few look at the core of democratic discourse: the parliament \[SOURCE needed?\].

WHAT IS THE RESEARCH GAP?

Some scholars distinguish between populist and popular rhetoric, but most empirical studies only focus on populist, not popular rhetoric. Furthermore, existing research demonstrates that populist rhetoric is widely distributed by populist actors through social media. Although populist actors often use snippets of their speeches on social media and it is a claim often made by news outlets \[SOURCE\], no research has linked a potential change in parliamentary rhetoric to social media yet.

This study aims to adress both. It builds on a theoretical framework for understanding reasons for and differences in rhetorical change in parliaments while aiming to examine this potential change over time demonstrating the link to social media. \[CHANGE IF RESULTS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS LINK\]

# Theory

Needs to explain why which parties are successful while others struggle. E.g.:

It is easier to employ 2 out of 3 populist tactics when you are in the opposition (anti-establishment, exclusion of outgroups). In Germany, far left or far right parties are not in power. Problem: was the green party using populist rhetoric to be successful? no \[SOURCE\], although they were in opposition, they did not use rhetoric, but rather popular rhetoric (adhere to the people in a more metaphorical pop-cultural way). Hence, opposition/government is not the only driver for choice of rhetoric. What else? Left-Right positioning? populism is typically right wing

populism always offers "the solution", that noone else offers. To be more credible with your solution, its best to be further away from the mainstream, so you can come up with a solution that noone has heard before/that is not commonly talked about in mainstream media \[SOURCE\].

## Hypotheses

H1: The general tone of speeches in parliament becomes more populist and more popular as social media becomes more relevant.

-   tone of speeches –\> sentiment analysis score (train model on populist vs popular vs non-pop rhetoric); two different scores per party: how populist and how popular rhetoric

-   relevance social media –\> different metrics, merged into a score? (more literature needed)

H2a: Parties in opposition are expected to show more populist tone will be, whereas governing parties are expected to employ more popular rhetoric.

-   Party position –\> party manifesto? Seating order in Bundestag? expert opinion? (more literature needed)

-   change in tone –\> sentiment analysis score

H2b: Extreme parties in opposition should show the highest level of populist rhetoric

# Methodology

Conduct a sentiment analysis for speeches in the German Bundestag over the last X years.

Correlate with relevance of social media (what measures relevance? user numbers? time spent on / usage frequency of social media? share of people using social media as their main source of information?)

Idea for descriptive stat:

Check in how many speeches the word gendern occurs across parties in the Bundestag. --\> Hypothesis: populist parties like the AfD and CSU talk a lot about them, others do not. \<-- They set the agenda and aim to make it look like big issue for the other (left-green) parties. Could also do a relative frequency analysis using slides from week 5 (chi²/Keyness analysis). expectation: populist parties will talk more about populist topics lol

# Results and Discussion

## Limitations

This paper is limited to data on parliamentary speeches and unrelated social media metrics. To consolidate inferences about a change in parliamentary rhetoric due to the increased relevance of social media, more data is needed. Matching social media posts with speeches in a quantitative rather than limited descriptive manner (like in this paper) would provide a clear image of which and when specific rhetoric is employed in parliament.

Furthermore, this work does not address the demand side of populist/popular rhetoric on social media. To understand, first, in which cases populist/popular rhetoric generates reach successfully, and second, in which cases digital success translates into political success, the demand side is a crucial, yet under-researched topic \[SOURCE\].
