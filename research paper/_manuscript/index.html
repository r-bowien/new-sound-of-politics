<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Media and Neo-Populism: A Contemporary Comparative Analysis;,citation_abstract=Mazzoleni, Stewart, Horsfield, and their contributors analyze the two-way relationship of the mass media and the contemporary phenomenon of extreme right wing neo-populist political parties which emerged in the closing years of the 20th century across the world. The success of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the neo-populist Front National, in the first French presidential ballot in April 2002 shows that these extremist parties have strong, if varying, electoral support. Drawn into reporting on the policies and antigovernment critiques of the new parties, the mass communication institutions, especially those engaged in news production, have been challenged by a variety of unconventional but effective political campaign strategies that caused many media professionals considerable challenge.Taking an approach informed by mass communication theory, this book analyzes eight case studies of the interaction of news media dynamics and neo-populism in Austria, Australia, France, Canada, India, Italy, the United States, and the Latin American region against the background of widespread disenchantment with traditional parties and the complacency and cynicism of popularly elected governments. Insights into media responses reveal how dependent on media coverage the neo-populist parties were and how, in many cases, the media were initially unequal to the confronting ideologies of the new parties. Although the news media exploited the new parties, new parties exploited the news media as well in quite shrewd and original ways. This is an important resource for scholars, students, and other researchers involved with political mass communications and right-wing political organizations.;,citation_author=Gianpietro Mazzoleni;,citation_author=Julianne Stewart;,citation_author=Bruce Horsfield;,citation_publication_date=2003-02;,citation_cover_date=2003-02;,citation_year=2003;,citation_isbn=978-0-313-05149-4;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Third Age of Political Communication: Influences and Features;,citation_abstract=This article identifies key changes in society and the media that have shaped political communication in many democracies over the postwar period. Three distinct ages are described. In the first, much political communication was subordinate to relatively strong and stable political institutions and beliefs. In the second, faced with a more mobile electorate, the parties increasingly &amp;amp;amp;quot;professionalized&amp;quot; and adapted their communications to the news values and formats of limited-channel television. In the third (still emerging) age of media abundance, political communication may be reshaped by five trends: intensified professionalizing imperatives, increased competitive pressures, anti-elitist populism, a process of &quot;centrifugal diversification,&quot; and changes in how people receive politics. This system is full of tensions, sets new research priorities, and reopens long-standing issues of democratic theory.;,citation_author=JAY G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Populist online communication: Interactions among politicians, journalists, and citizens (Dissertation summary);,citation_abstract=The recent rise of populist politicians in Western democracies is often associated with their allegedly successful use of digital media. However, for a long time, there has been little research specifically on populist online communication. To address this substantial research gap, the thesis pursues two major research aims: First, it investigates drivers of populist communication in politicians’ online self-presentation and online news media representation. Second, the thesis examines the effects of populist online communication on citizens’ behavior in the form of user reactions to politicians’ social media posts and reader comments on online news articles. Based on five internationally comparative studies and the overarching synopsis, the cumulative thesis demonstrates that populist online communication is driven by the reciprocal interactions among politicians, journalists, and citizens and is influenced by various factors on the macro, meso, and micro level. Furthermore, it shows that populist online communication resonates with citizens and is multiplied by them – specifically by citizens with prior strong populist attitudes. By analyzing the interactions of three key actor groups – politicians, journalists, and citizens – and by following a multimethod approach the dissertation connects research on both the supply and demand side of populism.;,citation_author=Sina Blassnig;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.hope.uzh.ch/scoms/article/view/3276;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.24434/j.scoms.2021.02.021;,citation_issn=2296-4150;,citation_volume=21;,citation_journal_title=Studies in Communication Sciences;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Socially mediated populism: The communicative strategies of political leaders on Facebook;,citation_abstract=Populism has been deﬁned in many different ways, mostly in regard to political ideology and political dynamics, but only in recent years in relation to communication variables. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the identiﬁcation of a socially mediated type of populist communication profoundly affected by the speciﬁc nature of social media. It presents and discusses empirical evidence on Italy’s populist and non-populist leaders that use Facebook regularly, and highlights the extent of the overﬂow of populist communication patterns and ideological features into mainstream political communication. Populist ideology fragments emerged in Italian leaders’ Facebook posts, thus leading to two main conclusions: ﬁrst, populism appears to be “endemic” in the Italian online facebooksphere; second, political actors—even non-populist ones—do not disdain the adoption of typical populist rhetorics.;,citation_author=Gianpietro Mazzoleni;,citation_author=Roberta Bracciale;,citation_publication_date=2018-04;,citation_cover_date=2018-04;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0104-x;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1057/s41599-018-0104-x;,citation_issn=2055-1045;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=Palgrave Communications;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Political Significance of Social Media Activity and Social Networks;,citation_abstract=This paper examines panel data from two waves of the Youth Participatory Politics Survey, a nationally representative sample of young people in the United States. It employs a cross-lagged design to investigate the extent to which common forms of online activity create pathways to online and offline forms of political activity. Specifically, we examine the influence of Friendship-Driven (FD) and Interest-Driven (ID) online activity on online participatory politics and on offline forms of political action. Our findings reveal that FD and ID activity relate to political engagement, but in different ways. In addition, we find that the size of young people’s social networks interacts with both FD and ID online activity to promote political activity. This indicates that having exposure to “weak-ties” (resulting from large social networks) promote higher levels of political engagement. These findings demonstrate the need to specify the kinds of online activities in which youth are engaged and, more broadly, the political significance of social media and social networks;,citation_author=Joseph Kahne;,citation_author=Benjamin Bowyer;,citation_publication_date=2018-07;,citation_cover_date=2018-07;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2018.1426662;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1080/10584609.2018.1426662;,citation_issn=1058-4609;,citation_volume=35;,citation_journal_title=Political Communication;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Social media and political communication: A social media analytics framework;,citation_abstract=In recent years, social media are said to have an impact on the public discourse and communication in the society. In particular, social media are increasingly used in political context. More recently, microblogging services (e.g., Twitter) and social network sites (e.g., Facebook) are believed to have the potential for increasing political participation. While Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions publicly through their networks, political institutions (e.g., politicians, political parties, political foundations, etc.) have also begun to use Facebook pages or groups for the purpose of entering into direct dialogs with citizens and encouraging more political discussions. Previous studies have shown that from the perspective of political institutions, there is an emerging need to continuously collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize politically relevant information from social media. These activities, which are subsumed under “social media analytics,” are considered difficult tasks due to a large numbers of different social media platforms as well as the large amount and complexity of information and data. Systematic tracking and analysis approaches along with appropriate scientific methods and techniques in political domain are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework for social media analytics in political context. More specifically, our framework summarizes most important politically relevant issues from the perspective of political institutions and corresponding methodologies from different scientific disciplines.;,citation_author=Stefan Stieglitz;,citation_author=Linh Dang-Xuan;,citation_publication_date=2013-12;,citation_cover_date=2013-12;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-012-0079-3;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s13278-012-0079-3;,citation_issn=1869-5469;,citation_volume=3;,citation_journal_title=Social Network Analysis and Mining;">

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
</section>
<section id="research-question" class="level1">
<h1>Research Question</h1>
<p>Do politicians adjust their tone to be generate more reach on social media? If so, does this lead to a more pronounced populist or popular tone? –&gt; what is the success strategy for which parties on social media?</p>
</section>
<section id="literature-review" class="level1">
<h1>Literature Review</h1>
<p>Literature makes distinction between populist and popular behaviour [NEED A LOT OF SOURCES HERE]. There is no consensus about the definition of populist rhetoric, however, three common traits can be identified. An extensive amount of literature relies on these concepts, this paper therefore uses them too.</p>
<p>How to define popular rhetoric? What makes it different to populist rhetoric? (maybe only adhere to the people while missing the other 2 aspects)</p>
<p>A lot of research on populist rhetoric in the current age focuses on social media content posted by politicians [<span class="citation" data-cites="stieglitz2013">(<a href="#ref-stieglitz2013" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>stieglitz2013?</strong></a>)</span>; SOURCES], few look at the core of democratic discourse: the parliament [SOURCE needed?].</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE RESEARCH GAP?</p>
<p>Literature distinguishes between populist and popular rhetoric, but most empirical studies only focus on populist, not popular rhetoric.</p>
</section>
<section id="theory" class="level1">
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>It is easier to employ 2 out of 3 populist tactics when you are in the opposition (anti-establishment, exclusion of outgroups). In Germany, far left or far right parties are not in power.</p>
<section id="hypotheses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h2>
<p>H1: The general tone of speeches in parliament becomes more populist and more popular as social media becomes more relevant.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>tone of speeches –&gt; sentiment analysis score (train model on populist vs popular vs non-pop rhetoric); two different scores per party: how populist and how popular rhetoric</p></li>
<li><p>relevance social media –&gt; different metrics, merged into a score? (more literature needed)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>H2a: Parties in opposition are expected to show more populist tone will be, whereas governing parties are expected to employ more popular rhetoric.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Party position –&gt; party manifesto? Seating order in Bundestag? expert opinion? (more literature needed)</p></li>
<li><p>change in tone –&gt; sentiment analysis score</p></li>
</ul>
<p>H2b: Extreme parties in opposition should show the highest level of populist rhetoric</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Conduct a sentiment analysis for speeches in the German Bundestag over the last X years.</p>
<p>Correlate with relevance of social media (what measures relevance? user numbers? time spent on / usage frequency of social media? share of people using social media as their main source of information?)</p>
<p>Idea for descriptive stat:</p>
<p>Check in how many speeches the word gendern occurs across parties in the Bundestag. –&gt; Hypothesis: populist parties like the AfD and CSU talk a lot about them, others do not. &lt;– They set the agenda and aim to make it look like big issue for the other (left-green) parties. Could also do a relative frequency analysis using slides from week 5 (chi²/Keyness analysis). expectation: populist parties will talk more about populist topics lol</p>
</section>
<section id="results-and-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This paper is limited to data on parliamentary speeches and unrelated social media metrics. To consolidate inferences about a change in parliamentary rhetoric due to the increased relevance of social media, more data is needed. Matching social media posts with speeches in a quantitative rather than limited descriptive manner (like in this paper) would provide a clear image of which and when specific rhetoric is employed in parliament.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this work does not address the demand side of populist/popular rhetoric on social media. To understand, first, in which cases populist/popular rhetoric generates reach successfully, and second, in which cases digital success translates into political success, the demand side is a crucial, yet under-researched topic [SOURCE].</p>
